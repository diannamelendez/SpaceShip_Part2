# SpaceShip_Part2
This project is the second part to a cumaltive homework assignment for an Object Oriented Computer Graphics Programming course(Fall 2018).

This project can be executed by importing the entire src files and the jar file under the dist folder. 
Run the program by entering the following command:

java -cp dist/A2Prj.jar:JavaSE.jar com.codename1.impl.javase.Simulator com.mycompany.a2.Starter

This iteration of the project focuses on Design Patterns and GUIs. THe goal of A2 is to extend from Assignment #1 
to incorporate several important design patterns, and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The rest of the game will
appear to the user to be similar to the one in A1, and most of the code from A1 will be reused, although it will
require some modification and reorganization. While this assignment adds a GUI, the map is still presented in text 
form on the console.
